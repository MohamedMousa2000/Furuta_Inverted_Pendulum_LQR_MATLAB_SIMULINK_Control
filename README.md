# Furuta_Inverted_Pendulum_LQR_MATLAB_SIMULINK_Control
Designing and Implementing Furuta Inverted Pendulum from scratch.
The algorithm was designed and controlled using MATLAB and SIMULINK.
We used LQR method to design the gains needed to control the pendulum.
You will find in the SIMULINK file (Furuta_Simulink_Final) the whole sequence to deploy the algorithm on an Arduino board (We used Mega)
